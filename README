With non numerical indices, the plugin can even act smartly:

As a bonus, the selection algorithm of the plugin can be used as a motion command:

USAGE
=====
The plugin provides one unique command: LazyList, which can be used to add/remove indices to/from a selection in NORMAL or VISUAL mode (This command can take 0 or 1 argument(s): The index).

The index can be:

    - A character or a string (e.g +, '* ','- ', 'Chapter X. '...)
    - A special pattern understandable by the plugin:
        %number%: Produces indices starting from number (e.g %1%, %33%...)
    - Both of them (e.g 'Chapter 1, part %1% - '...)
