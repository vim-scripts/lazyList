LazyList is a vim plugin who gives you possibility to create ordered and non ordered lists very quickly, and this by adding indices to the beginning of each line in the current selection.

With non numerical indices, the plugin can even act smartly:

usage
=====
The plugin provides one unique command: LazyList, which can be used to add/remove indices to/from a selection in NORMAL or VISUAL mode (This command can take 0 or 1 argument(s): The index).

The index can be:

    - A character or a string (e.g +, '* ','- ', 'Chapter X. '...)
    - A special pattern understandable by the plugin:
        %number%: Produces indices starting from number (e.g %1%, %33%...)
    - Both of them (e.g 'Chapter 1, part %1% - '...)

How to use the plugin, his configuration, all those informations can be found in the official repository:
